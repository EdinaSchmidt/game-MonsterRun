# Monster Run - My first game with pygame

I completed the Python Programming MOOC 2024 course offered by  Helsinki University. 
For the final task, I developed a small game. Due to peer review requirements, only the provided image files were allowed.

### The project requirements included:
- The game has a sprite the player can move in some way
- The game has some collectable items and/or enemies
- The player needs to be set a clear task in the game
- The game contains a counter which tells the player how they are doing in the game
- The source code for the game is divided into functions


### Main Features of Monster Run:
- The player controls a robot using the arrow keys
- The objective is to collect as many coins as possible while avoiding monsters
- Monsters spawn with each collected coin and move randomly until the player gets too close
- If the player approaches a monster, it begins chasing them
- Players must also steer clear of monster dens
- Every fifth coin collected spawns a collectible bomb
- Bombs can be detonated with the spacebar, eliminating nearby monsters unless walls block the blast
- Players win by escaping the level through one of the doors
- The final score is based on the total coins collected
